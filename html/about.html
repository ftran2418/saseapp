                        We host companies such as Capital One and Excella to educate our members on how to get hired and
                        what options their company may have for you.
                        We also hold professional workshops to improve your resumes, prepare you for interviews, and
                        much more.
                        On top of all that, we have monthly general body meetings for our members to know each better
                        and have fun (they also have food)!
                        To find out more on our events, go to our [events] page.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Another big part of our organization is our mentor/mentee program where you can get paired with
                        a mentor to help you adjust to Virginia Tech if you are a new student, help you with your
                        courses, or just be a guide to you in life!
                        We try our best to match our pairs according to personality and majors.

                        SASE was started in 2007 in response to other professional organizations that were geared
                        towards specific minority groups.

                        Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.

                        You can join at any time for just 20 dollars for the entire academic year by contacting one of our officers, or if you come to our first 2 general body meetings of the year, you can get a 5 dollar discount!
                        Membership allows you to be a part of our mentor/mentee program and be part of our events.
                        All memberships include a complementary T-shirt!
